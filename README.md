# This project was created to emulate the circuitry and displays used in the Akai AX-80 Polysynth.

I recently purchased both the Akai AX-80 processor board and voice board and managed to get them working to create a polysynth. 

Unfortunately I didn't have the nice AX-80 displays of the 1980's, so I decided that I could decode the original address and data lines of the AX-80 with modern micros and drive OLED screens using the online schematics.
